#     Choose 3 soldiers with index (i, j, k) with rating (rating[i], rating[j], rating[k]).
#     A team is valid if:  (rating[i] < rating[j] < rating[k]) or 
#     (rating[i] > rating[j] > rating[k]) where (0 <= i < j < k < n).
# Return the number of teams you can form given the conditions. 
# (soldiers can be part of multiple teams).
